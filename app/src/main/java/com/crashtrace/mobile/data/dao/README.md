# DAO (Data Access Object)

This folder contains interfaces and classes for accessing the app's database. DAOs define methods for database operations such as queries, inserts, updates, and deletes.

- Use this folder for Room DAO interfaces.
- Each DAO should be annotated with @Dao.

See the `db` and `entity` folders for related database components.
