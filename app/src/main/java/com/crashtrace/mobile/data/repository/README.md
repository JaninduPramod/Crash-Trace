# Repository

This folder contains repository classes that provide a clean API for data access to the rest of the app.

- Repositories abstract the data sources (local database, network, etc.).
- Use this layer to mediate between DAOs and ViewModels.

See the `dao`, `db`, and `entity` folders for data sources.
